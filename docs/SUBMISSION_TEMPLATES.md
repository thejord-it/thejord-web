Hey Product Hunt! I built THEJORD because I was tired of online tools that:
1. Upload my files to unknown servers
2. Require sign-ups for basic features
3. Show ads everywhere

```markdown
I got tired of online developer tools that:

- Bombard me with ads
- Limit free usage

So I built **THEJORD** - a suite of 14 free tools that run entirely in your browser.
