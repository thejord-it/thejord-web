<h1>Diff Checker: How to Compare Texts and Code Online</h1>

<p>Comparing different versions of files and documents is a fundamental operation for developers, content managers, and professionals working with code and text. A <strong>diff checker</strong> (or comparison tool) allows you to quickly identify differences between two versions of a document, highlighting additions, deletions, and modifications.</p>

<p>Our online Diff Checker is a free, fast, and privacy-first tool that processes everything directly in your browser without sending data to our servers. Perfect for comparing source code, configurations, documents, and any type of text.</p>

<h2>How a Diff Checker Works</h2>

<p>A diff checker analyzes two texts line by line using advanced comparison algorithms. The most common algorithm is <strong>Myers' diff algorithm</strong>, which identifies the minimum sequence of changes needed to transform one text into another.</p>

<p>The comparison process works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Line-by-Line Analysis</strong>: Text is split into lines and each line is compared with its counterpart in the other document</li>
<li><strong>Change Identification</strong>: The algorithm determines which lines were added (green), removed (red), or remained unchanged</li>
<li><strong>LCS Calculation</strong>: Uses Longest Common Subsequence to find the maximum sequence of common lines</li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong>: Results are presented in side-by-side or inline format with color highlighting</li>
</ul>

<p>Our tool supports two visualization modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Side-by-Side</strong>: Shows both texts side by side with highlighted differences</li>
<li><strong>Inline</strong>: Presents changes in a single column with + (addition) and - (removal) symbols</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Use Cases for Diff Checker</h2>

<h2>Practical Guide: How to Use the Diff Checker</h2>

<p>Here's a step-by-step tutorial to use our tool:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Paste the Texts to Compare</h3>

<p>Open the <a href="/tools/diff-checker">Diff Checker</a> and:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the left panel <strong>"Original Text"</strong>, paste the first version of your text or code</li>
<li>In the right panel <strong>"Modified Text"</strong>, paste the second version</li>
<li>You can upload files directly using the "Upload File" button</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Configure Options</h3>

<p>Customize the comparison according to your needs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Whitespace</strong>: Enable to ignore whitespace differences (useful for differently formatted code)</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Case</strong>: Enable for case-insensitive comparison</li>
<li><strong>Line Numbers</strong>: Show/hide line numbers</li>
<li><strong>View Mode</strong>: Choose between Side-by-Side or Inline</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Analyze Results</h3>

<p>The "Differences" panel shows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Green Lines with +</strong>: Lines added in the modified text</li>
<li><strong>Red Lines with -</strong>: Lines removed from the original</li>
<li><strong>Gray Lines</strong>: Unchanged lines</li>
<li><strong>Statistics</strong>: Total additions, deletions, and unchanged lines</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Export Results</h3>

<p>Once the analysis is complete, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Copy</strong>: Copy differences to clipboard</li>
<li><strong>Download</strong>: Save the result in TXT or HTML format</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong>: Generate a temporary link (optional, requires consent)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>

<ul>
<li>For code comparisons, use "Ignore Whitespace" to avoid false differences from formatting</li>
<li>When comparing configurations, keep line numbers active for precise references</li>
<li>For very large files (&gt;100KB), consider comparing specific sections</li>
<li>Save important results locally, as the tool doesn't store data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code Examples and Practical Usage</h2>

<p>Here are practical examples of using the diff checker in various scenarios:</p>

<h3>Example 1: Nginx Configuration Comparison</h3>

<p><strong>Original Text (Production):</strong></p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Modified Text (Staging):</strong></p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name staging.example.com;
    root /var/www/staging;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/key.pem;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Identified Differences:</strong> Port changed from 80 to 443, SSL configuration added, modified fallback routing.</p>

<h3>Example 2: API Response JSON Comparison</h3>

<p><strong>Version 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "subscription": "free"
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Version 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "verified": true
  },
  "subscription": "premium",
  "features": ["advanced", "priority"]
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Ideal for checking breaking changes in APIs during updates.</p>

<h3>Example 3: JavaScript Diff (Library)</h3>

<p>If you want to implement diff functionality in your JavaScript code:</p>

<pre><code>import { diffLines } from 'diff';

const text1 = 'First line\nSecond line\nThird line';
const text2 = 'First line\nModified line\nThird line';

const differences = diffLines(text1, text2);

differences.forEach((part) => {
  const color = part.added ? 'green' :
                part.removed ? 'red' : 'grey';
  console.log(`%c${part.value}`, `color: ${color}`);
});</code></pre>

<h3>Example 4: Git Diff in Terminal</h3>

<p>For developers working with Git:</p>

<pre><code># Show uncommitted differences
git diff

# Compare two branches
git diff main feature-branch

# Show only modified file names
git diff --name-only

# Compare specific file
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- config.json</code></pre>

<h3>Example 5: Database Migration Diff</h3>

<p><strong>Old Schema:</strong></p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);</code></pre>

<p><strong>New Schema:</strong></p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);</code></pre>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Identified UNIQUE constraint addition, new timestamp and boolean columns.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h3>What is a diff checker and what is it used for?</h3>

<p>A diff checker is a tool that compares two versions of a text or file to identify differences. It serves developers for code review, writers for tracking changes, and sysadmins for comparing configurations. It highlights additions (green), deletions (red), and unchanged lines.</p>

<h3>Is my data sent to your servers?</h3>

<p>No, absolutely not. Our Diff Checker processes everything locally in your browser using JavaScript. No data leaves your device, ensuring 100% privacy. You can verify this by opening DevTools and checking the Network tab: you'll see zero upload requests.</p>

<h3>Which diff algorithm do you use?</h3>

<p>We use Myers' diff algorithm, the same used by Git. This algorithm calculates the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) to determine the minimum sequence of changes. It's optimized for performance with O(ND) complexity where N is the sum of lengths and D is the number of differences.</p>

<h3>Can I compare very large files?</h3>

<p>Yes, but with some considerations. Being client-side, performance depends on your browser and hardware. Files up to 5MB work perfectly. For larger files (&gt;10MB), we recommend comparing specific sections or using desktop tools like Beyond Compare.</p>

<h3>Do you support code comparison with syntax highlighting?</h3>

<p>Currently the diff checker shows differences in plain text format with color highlighting (green/red). For language-specific syntax highlighting, you can use side-by-side mode and maintain the original indentation, which helps code readability.</p>

<h3>How does the "Ignore Whitespace" option work?</h3>

<p>When you enable "Ignore Whitespace", the algorithm normalizes whitespace before comparison. This means differences caused only by indentation, multiple spaces, or tabs vs spaces are ignored. Useful for comparing code formatted with different tools (Prettier, Black, etc).</p>

<h3>Can I save the comparison results?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can copy results to clipboard or download them in TXT/HTML format. Results are not saved on the server (there's no database). If you close the tab, data is lost, so save locally what you need.</p>

<h3>Does the diff checker work offline?</h3>

<p>Yes! After the first page load, all necessary JavaScript is in the browser cache. You can use the tool even without internet connection. Ideal for working with sensitive data without risks.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between Side-by-Side and Inline modes?</h3>

<p><strong>Side-by-Side</strong> mode shows both texts side by side, highlighting differences in parallel. It's ideal for quick visual comparisons. <strong>Inline</strong> mode shows changes sequentially with + (additions) and - (deletions), similar to git diff. Useful for seeing the flow of changes.</p>
